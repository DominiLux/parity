I've been at it for about six hours now chasing around compile time errors.  As I find a fix for one I break something
else.  However, i'm getting pretty close to a solution as i've gotten rid of all the original errors and now i'm seeing a whole
new set of errors.  It seems like there is one or two more files that need modifying because they were not original coded to
recognize a BSD Operating system.  It's all part of the process and porting software can almost be compared to trying to get a
Volxwagon to launch itself into space...

I think i'll get back to work on this some time tommorow evening for a few hours.  It is not possible for there to be much
left to do.  The biggest issue i've been running into is having to fork other repositories because everything is somewhat
scattered.  However, once completed I expect there to be less than 20 lines of code total to send upstream for a successfull
master branch that will compile on Linux, Windows, OSX, and BSD systems.
